/**
 * @class KeyVal
 *
 * This class is an interface to a system that can 
 * arbitrarily track key/value pairs.  The abiltiy to 
 * build an "associative array" will be invaluable
 * to a coder
 *
 * An associative array allows the coder to fetch
 * an object by using a key.  This essentially makes
 * a content addressable data structure.
 *
 * All derived classes must use this template verbatim
 *
 * Notes:
 * 1. Objects that are used as keys in the table 
 *    must have the less than operator defined.
 * 2. KeyVal objects should be creatable on both the
 *    stack and the heap
 * 3. KeyVal objects should be assignable and copy constructible
 *    and should make deep copies as appropriate
 * 4. The forEach method should iterate over the structure in 
 *    sorted order least to greatest according to key value
